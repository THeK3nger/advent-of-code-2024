# Advent of Code 2024 in Janet

After a small dip last year, this year I continue to experiment with [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/), a really fun minimal Lisp language (inspired by Clojure) that I have been looking at for a while.

Janet's PEG ("parsing expression grammar") are really fun to work with, and they make parsing the AoC input files (usually the most boring part of the challenge) a really fun task. Especially if you have a weird fetish for formal grammars like I do.

## Running the code

Once you have Janet installed, you can go into the day folder and run the code with:

```sh
janet day1.janet
```
