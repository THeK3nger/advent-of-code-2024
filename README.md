# Advent of Code 2023 in Janet

I know. It is not AoC season yet (actually, being June, I don't know if I should say "not yet AoC season" or "still AoC season"). But I wanted to experiment with [Janet](https://janet-lang.org/), a really fun minimal Lisp language (inspired by Clojure) that I have been looking at for a while.

Janet's PEG ("parsing expression grammar") are really fun to work with, and they make parsing the AoC input files (usually the most boring part of the challenge) a really fun task. Especially if you have a weird fetish for formal grammars like I do.

In any case, this is less than a challenge than usual. I am trying to get a better feel for the language and, for that, I am following along [Ian Henry's series](https://www.youtube.com/@ianthehenry). Some days will be more "original" than others, but, in any case, you should check his videos if you are interested in learning Janet.

## Running the code

Once you have Janet installed, you can go into the day folder and run the code with:

```sh
janet day1.janet
```
